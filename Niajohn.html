    <h4  id='WHO'></h4>
    <p>My name is Nia John. I'm 19 years old I've achieved 10 GCSEs and 2 A Levels at sixth form. I'm currently taking a 6 week course called the talent tech accelerator to prepare myself for a software engineering apprenticeship in the future. I hope to improve my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript which will hopefully lead me into a web development career. </p>
    <div class="col-md-4">  </div>
    <h4></h4>
   <p>I believe that I'm well suited for a software engineering apprenticeship as I am very commited to what I do meaning if I have to dedicate my time to something I will give my all to that to make sure that it's a success. I also believe that I'm great at verbal communication I know how to get my points across clearly so that I am easily understood by all. <br> I think it's also good to be an active listener especially when working in large teams and with mulitple teams as you will need to understand what work needs to be done to get a project completed. Time management is also another vital skill needed in software engineering as tickets will need to be developed on time for a project to be delivered to a client on time.

    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>

<h3 class="text" > Why Software Engineering?</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4"> </div>
    <h4 id='WHY'></h4>
    <p>Even though I have an idea on where I eventually want to end up in tech, I still want to explore all the possibilities software engineering has to offer as I could come to chane my mind in the future. I've also researched how software engineering/tech has changed the world as we know it from how we use a computer day to day, and the software on our various devices such as our moblies phones has redefined the way we interact with people and the world. I also like the balance that software engineering offers between the analytical and creative skills such as blogging and problem solving. I truly believe that software engineering can only continue to move forward due to the needs of the world in the coming future and I'd like to be apart of that.  </p>

<h3 class="text" >Hobbies And Achievements?</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4"> </div>
    <h4 id='HOBBIES' ></h4>
    <p>One of my favourite things to do in my free time is <strong><em>reading</strong></em>. I love books in all forms such as the classic novel, manga, comics and webtoons. I truly feel like reading is an exciting way to not only escape into a fantasy but to also develop you own world view through another person's mind, which some could argue is a powerful thing. A talented author should will bring stimulate empathy for their characters even if they contain different viewpoints to yourself which might give you a certain degree of discomfort. Being an avid book lover I can say that I've easily lost entire days possibly weeks to a book or series that has enslaved my mind and enraptured me. Which brings me to the one the thing I hate about books I throughly enjoy: the end. Nothing can compare to the post-book ending depression every book lover goes through when reading the final pages; it's honestly a devasting moment. which can only be cured by another book to where the cycle continues again and again.  </p>
    <div class="col-md-4">  </div>
    <h4></h4>
   <p>I've also come to enjoy gaming as it is my favourite way to relax and relieve stress. I have come to see games as an interactive book but one which gives me more control over the world given to me to play in almost makes me feel <strong>"Godlike"</strong>. From doing my own independat research I think that games should be reconsider a very unique and vast art form due to the diversity within all types of games. These games being GTA, Horizon Zero Dawn, Persona 5; The Witcher 3; Sunset Overdrive being just a few to mention. All of those that I have  mentioned contain beautiful art within them as well as various styles. Gaming is what motivated me to gte into software engineering and hopefully I'll be able to create something great as a video game one day.   </p>
